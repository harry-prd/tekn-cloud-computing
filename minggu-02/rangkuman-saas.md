# SaaS (Software as as Service)
[Summarized from](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-IaaS-SaaS-and-Paas) The article explains the differences between Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS provides users with access to basic computing resources like servers, storage, and networking, while PaaS offers a platform for building, testing, and deploying applications, and SaaS delivers fully functional software applications to end-users over the internet. The main difference between these three services is the level of control and responsibility that the user has over the infrastructure, platform, and software. IaaS provides the most control and responsibility, while SaaS provides the least. PaaS falls in between, offering some level of control over the platform while abstracting away the underlying infrastructure.
